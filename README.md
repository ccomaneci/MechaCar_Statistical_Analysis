## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### There are different variables that can have an effect on the MPG of MechaCar protoypes and we used the linear regression model to help use predict what some of those variables are. It was determiend that the vehicle length and ground clearance had the biggest impact on the MPG. 

### Taking a look at the p-value we determined that the slop is non-zero.

### This linear model has an R-squared value of 0.7149, which means that 71% of the predictions can be used when determining what veriables can have an effect on the MPG.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

### These desgin specifications were not properly met in this manufacturing data. We were able to determine this because we know that the variance should not exceed 100 pounds so we ran two reports that can let us know the avg variance. The total summary included the results of all vehicles and the lot summary broke the data down into 3 lots. Comparing everthing together it would appear that everything met the variance requirement however when broken down into lots, lot 3 was determine to have a variance too high.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

### By using a t-test we could determine the PSI for all the manufacturing lots. Each manufacturing lot needed to have a PSI of 1500 but lot 3 was just under the requirement.
